min_heapify is a rebalancing function that reblances the heaps when we add them.

min_heapify compares the parent and children of the node

most of the functions were unrelated in our instance and used in the 

the heap is a tree data structure that will have the least used values at the top and the most frequent at the bottom of the list. We are using a tree like structure in an array. Quick searches of O(n) at worst and O(1) on average will result in this compression algorithm.
